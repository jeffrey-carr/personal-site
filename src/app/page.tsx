          <p>
            I&apos;ve been interested in computers since middle school when I started playing video games and thought it was amazing what{" "}
            you could do with a computer. Freshman year of high school, I started a programming club as a place where students could{" "}
            collaborate and learn about programming. In college, I started a video game development club to help other students help{" "}
            each other learn the in&apos;s and out&apos;s of video game development. The club grew up to over 50 members.
          </p>
          <p>
            In my free time, I like to play around with programming projects trying to learn new skills. I also enjoy playing sports{" "}
            with my friends. If I&apos;m feeling especially active that day, I might enjoy going outside on a hike. A couple summers ago I{" "}
            spent a lot of time with my mom driving from Massachusetts to California and back. She even made a{" "}
            short <a href="https://jeffjeanusa.blogspot.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">blog</a> about it!

          <p>There are a few web projects that I&apos;ve created in my free time to work on my web development skills</p>
          <br />
          <ol>
            <li>
              <a href="/">This site!</a> This site was created as a landing page to introduce myself to anyone who wants{" "}
              to get to know me. This site was written from scratch using NextJS and React. The SASS is all custom.
            </li>
            <li>
              <a href="https://recipe.jeffreycarr.dev" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Recipe Book</a>. I created the {" "}
              recipe book as a small way to honor my late mother. She saved a binder of recipes that my family loved.{" "}
              The web app is a full stack web application written in pure HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. The app allows for{" "}
              saving favorite recipes, creating new recipes, and editing existing recipes.
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                <a href="https://games.jeffreycarr.dev" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Web Games</a>. These are some {" "}
                simple web games that I created to practice my code and show some games to my friends. This site boasts{" "}
                a Sveltekit 5 frontend and a Golang backend.
              </p>
              <p>
                This project was also a great opportunity to work on creating a continuous deployment pipeline. The repo is{" "}
                set up to automatically run a deploy script when a new tag is pushed to the repo. The deploy script is a{" "}
                Github Action. The action will compile the Go code, zip the compiled code along with the production config{" "}
                files, then upload that as an artifact. It will then SSH to my cloud VM, download the artifact, unzip the{" "}
                file to the correct directory, and restart the service. The action then triggers a Cloudflare webhook to{" "}
                trigger a deployment of the frontend.
